## Terraform Provisioner  | Remote-Exec ðŸš€



ðŸŽ¯  Key Features
```
âœ… Provisioners can be used to model specific actions on the local machine or on a remote machine in order to prepare servers or other infrastructure objects for service
âœ… The local-exec provisioner invokes a local executable after a resource is created. This invokes a process on the machine running Terraform, not on the resource
âœ… The remote-exec provisioner invokes a script on a remote resource after it is created. This can be used to run a configuration management tool, bootstrap into a cluster, etc. To invoke a local process, see the local-exec provisioner instead. The remote-exec provisioner supports both ssh and winrm type connections.
âœ… Most provisioners require access to the remote resource via SSH or WinRM, and expect a nested connection block with details about how to connect. Connection blocks don't take a block label, and can be nested within either a resource or a provisioner.
âœ… The self object represents the provisioner's parent resource, and has all of that resource's attributes. For example, use self.public_ip to reference an aws_instance's public_ip attribute.
âœ… Go to your local machine and run the following command.
